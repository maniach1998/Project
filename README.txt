->DESCRIPTION:
    The MSSRS Restaurant app is a Python-based application aiming at helping Cashiers at restaurants to generate invoices,
    and to store data of customers that visit them. It is a GUI-based application, making it as user-friendly as possible.
    It generates a bill at the end which is stored in its own dataset, and also features e-mailing the bill to the customer’s
    mail. Also for the cashier’s use, the application features analysis of Veg and Non-Veg dishes ordered in the days of the
    week, as well as number of customers visiting. It also shows the number of customers visiting in a week using a bar graph.
